## Topics covered
- Recapitulation on Tables:
    - Primary keys
    - Foreign keys

## What I understood
- The better practice to join tables is to have the join on a foreign key with a primary key.
- Types of Joins
    - **Left join** -> maintains all the information from the first table, discarding the null, or incomplete information from the second table.
    - **Right join** -> maintains all the info from the second table, discarding the null or incomplete info from the first one.
    - **Full join** -> maintains all the information from both tables.
    - **Cross join** -> returns the cartesian product from both tables.
    - **Self join** -> relates rows within the same table.

\* When selecting rows that we wish to have a value set to `NULL`, the way to do it is using `value IS NULL` (not `value = NULL`).
